# CryptoClustering, Module 11 Challenge

This challenge consisted of looking at K-means and PCA to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes.

We began with starter code [Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb](https://github.com/mikeyms1/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb).

The data provided can be found in the **Resources\crypto_market_data.csv** file which can be found [here](https://github.com/mikeyms1/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Resources/crypto_market_data.csv).

My final analysis can be found in the [Crypto_Clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/mikeyms1/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Crypto_Clustering.ipynb) file.
